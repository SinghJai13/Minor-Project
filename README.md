# Minor-Project-Face Age Progression

#Introduction

Age progression is the process of aesthetically rendering a given face
image to present the effects of aging. It is often used in the entertainment
industry and forensics, e.g., forecasting facial appearances of young
children when they grow up or generating contemporary photos for missing
individuals. The intrinsic complexity of physical aging, the interferences
caused by other factors (e.g., PIE variations), and shortage of labeled
aging data collectively makes face age progression a rather difficult
problem. The last few years have witnessed significant efforts tackling this
issue, where aging accuracy and identity permanence are commonly
regarded as the two underlying premises of its success .The early attempts
were mainly based on the skinâ€™s anatomical structure and they
mechanically simulated the profile growth and facial muscle changes w.r.t.
the elapsed time.
