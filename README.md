# Minor-Project-Face Age Progression

## 1. Introduction

Age progression is the process of aesthetically rendering a given face image to present the effects of aging. It is often used in the entertainment 
industry and forensics, e.g., forecasting facial appearances of young
children when they grow up or generating contemporary photos for missing
individuals. The intrinsic complexity of physical aging, the interferences
caused by other factors (e.g., PIE variations), and shortage of labeled
aging data collectively makes face age progression a rather difficult
problem.

The last few years have witnessed significant efforts tackling this
issue, where aging accuracy and identity permanence are commonly
regarded as the two underlying premises of its success. The early attempts
were mainly based on the skinâ€™s anatomical structure and they
mechanically simulated the profile growth and facial muscle changes w.r.t.
the elapsed time.

## 2. Motivation

One of the primary motivations behind doing this project was to undertake
a challenging project in the vast and immensely popular field of deep
learning. The wide and significant applications of this project also
encouraged us to take up this project which can be extended among
various fields and scenarios.

This project could find many useful applications in the government agency
itself. Our government always needs to maintain records of different people
for its efficient functioning. The records could be associated with a criminal
or could be of a missing child. The images linked with the respective record
could be old enough that might render them useless for the purpose of
precise recognition.
